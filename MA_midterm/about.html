        <h2>The car ride back home</h2>
        <p class = "bodytextleft">
            After driving for 4 hours to Spokane, we finally met up with the dog breeder that had Mocha. We played with him for a bit, then gave hime a treat and started the ride back home.
            The breeder said that he would most likely wimper, however he was very quiet. We gave him a toy to play with (see the gallery for a picture of him on the way back).
            On the 4-hour drive back, he spent most of the time sleeping, and I gave him a lot of belly and ear scratches. <br>
            When we were home, we already had an area for Mocha. He seemed really tired, and fell asleep pretty fast.

        <h2>Mocha's 3 Birthdays</h2>
        <p class = "bodytextleft">
            For Mocha's birthday each year, we bake him a cake (see the gallery for image). For his 2nd birthday, we also got him a box of toys. It contained various chew toys and squeaky toys.

        <h2>At the dog park (last week)</h2>
        <p class = "bodytextleft">
            Last week, we took Mocha to one of the biggest off-leash dog parks in our area, the one in Marymoore. He was really excited to go, 
            since the last time we went was more than 3 months ago. The second we let him off leash, he dashed off to play with other dogs. After a while, 
            he came back and we went on the loop around the park. We ended up spending an hour there, and Mocha was exhausted, so we went home.
